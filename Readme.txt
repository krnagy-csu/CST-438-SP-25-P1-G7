JOB SEARCH PROGRAM

This program is intended to help users find jobs that match their skills.
First, install the program onto your device.
Next, make an account. This is accessible via a button on the login page.
Once the account is made, it is stored in the database. Return to the login page. On subsequent visits, the user may log in directly using an existing account.
Upon logging in, the user sees the landing page.
The user may select a skill they have, retrieved from the API, from a window in the landing page. This skill is stored as part of their account in the database.
Navigating to the job list page shows a list of jobs which require that skill.
The user selects a job they like and is presented with its contact information (if available.)
