[Github Repo](https://github.com/krnagy-csu/CST-438-SP-25-P1-G7)

## Overview
This is a job search application that makes use of an API we found here.

Users are able to create an account and find jobs that are relevant to them.

## Introduction
Communication was handled through Slack primarily, with an open DM channel that we all shared progress updates and information through. We also had meetings in Zoom, and meetings in class.
How many stories/issues were initially considered: 21
How many stories/issues were completed: 18

+ What was your role / which stories did you work on
  + I handled merging, documentation and was part of the API team. I worked on issues 8, 9, and 11.
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + The biggest challenge was figuring out that the API we planned to use didn’t work, and figuring out how to implement a new API in time to get the project working.
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + It was a challenge both because a significant amount of time had to be invested to figure out that this API would not work, and because finding, assessing, and deploying this new API took a significant amount of time during what was already a fairly time-pressed part of the project.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + Thanks to the help of Alex, mostly, who took his own initiative to find and deploy the new API while I continued struggling with the old one.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Seeing it come together at the end. For so long it felt like we were just working on small pieces, but watching them be put together and work was so nice.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + Communicate, communicate, communicate. Set clear expectations of what each member should be doing each week; set clear expectations for everyone’s area of focus; ask how it’s going throughout the week; always make sure you know what everyone else is working on and how you can assist. Also, I’d start with the new API.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + The importance of keeping up with tasks and communicating with teammates.

+ What was your role / which stories did you work on
  + I work on front and and back end development. I focused on the sign up pages, the database creation and functions, and some login features
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + I would say my biggest challenge was creating the database. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I hadn’t had any experiences with databases before this project was definitely a beneficial experience. It wasn’t hard looking back at it.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + I just watched youtube videos about databases and in addition learned about proper styles
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + My favorite / interesting part was learning how to use react native
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would have started the database earlier so that I could have had more time to implement more functions
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + The most valuable thing was learning how to work with databases

+ What was your role / which stories did you work on 
  + Login page, recycleview stuff, database/backend stuffs, and attempted to populate the databases
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Learning to deal with databases and APIs, working with other people!
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + It felt like there was always a bug. I had to figure out how to debug.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + Groupmates helped a lot, felt like they were walking me through alot
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Honestly, learning more about how to work with teammates, I can honestly say I am quite terrible at it.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + Oh god, ask teammates sooner when you get stuck for a different perspective!!! They were literally able to point it out in a split second when I spent over an hour trying to figure it out because they ran into the same problem, just to cause more bugs!
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + The importance of early communication as well as effective communication, definitely need to develop the skill of working as a group.

+ What was your role / which stories did you work on
  + I focused on a lot of the front end work as well as navigation and API fetching.
+ What was the biggest challenge?
  + The biggest challenge was getting the API to store information into our database. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + It was challenging because the emulator has a lot of packages or imports that do not always work. 
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + This task was divide and conquer, and with the help of everyone we got it done.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + I enjoy the design aspect of this project creating a simple but clean UI.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would like us to communicate more effectively.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + I learned that it is good to work as a team, it makes tackling tasks easier since we can lean on each other.

## Conclusion
### How successful was the project?
(Think in terms of what did you set out to do and what actually got done.)

Despite setbacks and difficulties, this was a fairly successful project. We set out to make an app where you could create an account, input a skill, and have a list of jobs retrieved from an API that was filtered to only show ones that used that skill. Despite some features being cut, the final product resembles that vision. There was a major setback in that the API we initially used, which was supposed to both be relatively easy to incorporate and also support filtering by skills, was found to be unfit for purpose and a new one had to quickly be chosen and integrated; but despite this, we still ended up with a functional app that allows users to search for and find jobs relevant to them.

Overall, the project was a success.


### What was the largest victory?

Finally putting everything together and seeing it work. There were so many moving parts and broken things and panicked fixes, but once it was properly working, it was amazing.

### Final assessment of the project

There were a lot of things that went right and a lot of things that went wrong. But overall, it was a good project.
